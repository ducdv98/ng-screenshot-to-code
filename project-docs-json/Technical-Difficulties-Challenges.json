    {
      "name": "Pixel Perfection & Style Accuracy (Image Input)",
      "challenge": "VLMs interpret images semantically, not by pixel mapping. They *guess* the structure and styling. Accurately extracting exact hex codes, font names (if not common), complex gradients, or precise pixel dimensions from a raster image is extremely difficult and prone to errors or hallucinations.",
      "mitigation": "Use sophisticated prompting, potentially pre-process the image to extract dominant colors/fonts if possible (though hard), and clearly set user expectations that the output is a *starting point*, not a flawless replica. Focus on *functional* and *visual similarity*."
    },
    {
      "name": "AI Hallucinations & Inconsistency",
      "challenge": "VLMs can invent elements, misinterpret components, generate invalid Angular/HTML syntax, or produce inconsistent code structure or styling. The output can vary even for the same input.",
      "mitigation": "Strong prompt engineering with clear instructions, examples (few-shot prompting), potentially adding a validation layer to check generated code syntax, and allowing users to easily edit the output."
    },
    {
      "name": "Angular Material & Tailwind Specificity",
      "challenge": "Instructing the AI to correctly: Identify when to use a specific Angular Material component (`mat-button` vs. a styled `<a>` tag), Apply Tailwind classes *correctly* within the Angular template syntax, Generate the basic Angular component structure (`.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`).",
      "mitigation": "Very detailed prompts specifying the desired output format, target libraries, and providing examples of Angular Material/Tailwind usage within Angular components. Fine-tuning a model (if feasible/affordable) could help, but prompt engineering is the primary tool."
    },
    {
      "name": "Figma API Complexity & Mapping",
      "challenge": "The Figma API provides rich, structured data, but mapping its concepts (nodes, auto-layout, constraints, styles, variants, components) accurately to HTML, Angular Material components, and especially TailwindCSS classes requires complex logic. Auto Layout to Flexbox/Grid conversion can be intricate. Handling nested Figma components and variants adds complexity.",
      "mitigation": "Start with basic node types (Frames, Rectangles, Text). Incrementally add support for Auto Layout, constraints, and component mapping. Use libraries for Figma API interaction. Build a robust mapping engine."
    },
    {
      "name": "Component Granularity & Structure",
      "challenge": "The AI might generate one large monolithic HTML blob. Deciding how to break down a complex screenshot/design into logical, reusable Angular child components is a higher-level architectural task that AI struggles with.",
      "mitigation": "Initially focus on generating a single component. Advanced versions could *suggest* potential component boundaries, but automatic, perfect componentization is unlikely."
    },
    {
      "name": "Handling Interactivity & State",
      "challenge": "This tool focuses on the presentation layer. Generating TypeScript logic for event handling, state management, data binding (beyond basic property binding), or API calls is currently beyond the reliable scope of VLM-based image-to-code generation.",
      "mitigation": "Clearly define the scope: generate the static structure and styling. Users must add interactivity and logic manually."
    },
    {
      "name": "Live Preview Implementation",
      "challenge": "Safely rendering arbitrary user-generated Angular components within the host application. Security (XSS) and isolation are concerns. Dynamically compiling and rendering Angular components is non-trivial.",
      "mitigation": "Use a sandboxed iframe. Serve the generated HTML/CSS/JS (potentially compiled Angular code, or more simply, just the HTML/Tailwind for a static preview) within the iframe from a different origin or using `srcdoc`. A full Angular component preview would require dynamic compilation or using Web Components/Elements. Start with a static HTML/Tailwind preview in an iframe."
    },
    {
      "name": "VLM API Costs & Rate Limits",
      "challenge": "Different VLM providers have varying costs and rate limits. Models like GPT-4V are expensive per call, while others like Gemini may offer better cost efficiency. Frequent use can lead to high operational costs. Rate limits might affect user experience during high traffic.",
      "mitigation": "Use Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash as the primary model for cost efficiency with good capabilities. Fall back to alternatives like Claude 3 Haiku/Sonnet or GPT-4V only when necessary. Implement caching where possible (though unlikely for unique images). Optimize prompts to minimize token usage. Implement usage quotas or paid tiers if necessary."
    },
    {
      "name": "Environment Setup for Generated Code",
      "challenge": "The generated code assumes a specific Angular project setup (Angular CLI, Material installed, Tailwind configured).",
      "mitigation": "Provide clear instructions or a setup script for users on how to integrate the generated component into their existing Angular project, including necessary `npm install` commands and Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`, `styles.scss`)."
