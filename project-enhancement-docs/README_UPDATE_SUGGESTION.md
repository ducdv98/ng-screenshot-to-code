# Suggestion for Updating Main README.md

The main `README.md` in the project root should be updated to reflect the current status post-MVP and guide new contributors.

**Suggested Sections to Add/Update:**

1.  **Project Title & Description:** Ensure it accurately reflects the goal (Image *and* Figma to Angular Code).
2.  **Current Status:** Briefly mention that the MVP (Image-to-Code) is complete and functional. List the core features currently available (as described in `ROADMAP.md`'s "Current Status").
3.  **Technology Stack:** Link to or summarize the `Technology-Stack.json` contents.
4.  **Project Structure:** Link to `Project-Structure.json` or provide a simplified overview.
5.  **Getting Started / How to Run:**
    *   Update setup instructions for both frontend (`cd frontend && npm install`) and backend (`cd backend && python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    *   Explain how to set up environment variables (`cp backend/.env.example backend/.env` and fill in API keys - **emphasize getting a Google AI API Key**).
    *   Provide commands to run both servers (`cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`, `cd frontend && ng serve`).
    *   Mention accessing the app at `http://localhost:4200`.
6.  **Roadmap / Next Steps:**
    *   Briefly state the current focus (e.g., Enhancing Core Conversion & Preview - Phase 2).
    *   Link to the detailed `ROADMAP.md` file for future plans.
7.  **(Optional) Contributing:** Add a section linking to `CONTRIBUTING_GUIDELINES.md` (once created, likely as part of Phase 4) outlining contribution process, code style, etc.
