# Next Steps for Implementation

Based on the updated implementation status in IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md, the following are the next steps for continuing the project implementation:

## Immediate Next Steps

### Complete Task 3.E5: Improved Mapping Error Feedback

The following tasks need to be completed to finish the implementation of improved mapping error feedback:

1. **Update GeneratedCode Model**:
   - Modify the `GeneratedCode` interface in `frontend/src/app/models/generated-code.model.ts` to include a `warnings` array:
   ```typescript
   export interface GeneratedCode {
     component_ts: string;
     component_html: string;
     component_scss: string;
     component_name: string;
     warnings?: string[]; // Add this property
   }
   ```

2. **Update Backend Response**:
   - Modify `backend/app/models/generated_code.py` to include warnings in the response model
   - Update `backend/app/services/code_generator.py` to return warnings in the API response instead of just injecting them as HTML comments

3. **Display Warnings in UI**:
   - Update `frontend/src/app/pages/generator-page/generator-page.component.html` to display warnings if present
   - Add a warnings section above or below the code preview
   - Use Material design components (e.g., MatChip or alerts) to display warnings in a user-friendly way

4. **Clear Warnings Between Generations**:
   - Update `frontend/src/app/pages/generator-page/generator-page.component.ts` to clear warnings when starting a new generation
   - Reset warning state in both image and Figma submission handlers

## Next Priority Tasks

After completing Task 3.E5, the following tasks should be implemented next:

### 1. UI/UX Improvements

1. **Enhance Accessibility**:
   - Add proper ARIA labels to interactive elements
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation
   - Add focus indicators for better accessibility

2. **Improve Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Test and optimize UI layout for various screen sizes
   - Ensure proper component sizing and arrangement on mobile devices

3. **Add Loading Animations**:
   - Improve loading state visuals with more detailed progress indicators
   - Add skeleton loaders for UI components during data loading

### 2. Documentation Updates

1. **Update README.md**:
   - Add comprehensive setup instructions
   - Document API endpoints and their parameters
   - Include screenshots of the application

2. **Create Developer Documentation**:
   - Document the application architecture
   - Create component diagrams
   - Document data flow between components

3. **Add User Guide**:
   - Create step-by-step usage instructions
   - Document features and limitations

### 3. Begin Phase 4: Testing and Advanced Features

1. **Set Up Testing Framework**:
   - Implement unit tests for critical components
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Set up end-to-end testing for critical user flows

2. **Add Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement lazy loading for components
   - Optimize API response handling
   - Add caching where appropriate

3. **Implement Advanced Features**:
   - Add code editing capabilities
   - Implement component splitting suggestions
   - Add export options for generated components

## Long-term Tasks

1. **Expand Figma Integration**:
   - Improve Figma-to-Angular mapping
   - Add support for Figma styles and design tokens
   - Implement more advanced component recognition

2. **Add Multi-framework Support**:
   - Add option to generate React components
   - Support for Vue.js component generation
   - Abstract component generation for multiple frameworks

3. **Enhance AI Integration**:
   - Implement fine-tuning for the AI models
   - Add user feedback mechanisms to improve AI output
   - Include more contextual information in AI prompts

These tasks should be prioritized based on project requirements and resource availability.
